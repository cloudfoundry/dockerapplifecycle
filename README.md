# Dockerapplifecycle

The docker app lifecycle implements a Docker deployment strategy for
Cloud Foundry on Diego.

The **Builder** extracts the start command and execution metadata from
the docker image.

The **Launcher** executes the start command with the correct Cloud
Foundry and docker environment.
